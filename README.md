# Motivation For This Project

Groce' Inflation was created as my first big project in the Full Time Web Development Boot Camp, Cohort #54, at Nashville Software School. The Capstone Project is the conclusion of the front-end (Javascript/HTML/CSS) portion of the course and I wanted to make a website that utilized my awareness of insane grocery price fluctuations over that last few years and makes a hobby of tracking small-scale inflation data for the stores where I shop.

# How Groce' Inflation Works

Users can create a profile using just a name and email (the email is not used by the site other than log in so feel free to use a fake!). 

Once logged in, users can manage a list of products they buy from different vendors and log purchases for those products, then those purchases are displayed on a chart that graphs price and dates on each purchase of a given product, allowing the user to observe the change over time.

# How Groce' Inflation Was Developed

I developed this project over the course of a couple weeks. The first week, I struggled against MUI, React Bootstrap, Reactstrap and AnimateCSS which are all external CSS libraries that each in their own turn confused matters a great deal, but the process thoroughly retaught me CSS fundamentals and I managed to squeak out an MVP by the deadline. Over the second week, I was able to add additional functionality including incorporating ChartJS with a Json API, and redoing the wire-frames I had built which allowed me to use the better planned UI to redesign and rebuild my component locations and behaviors.

# Difficulties/Lessons Learned  

The difficulties I ran into on this project had mostly to do with mismatching documentation with tutorials and other online resources. All of the React-ChartJS-2 documentation was written in Tsx, and all the tutorials I could find were using an outdated version of ChartJS so interpreting each resource for my use case took up massive amounts of time and I ended up writing much more code than I used. I learned that taking time to think about your plan of attack in order to utilize resources is a necessary step before copy-pasting any code at all. Committing too early to an idea or tech structure creates a lot of unnecessary constraints and extra labor if you then have to redo it or when it doesn't work with the dataflow you later require.
